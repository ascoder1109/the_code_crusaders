# DNK ExportEase

ExportEase is your ultimate destination for purchasing and exporting Micro and Small Enterprise (MSE) handicrafts. Discover an exquisite array of artisanal creations, from jewellery to textiles, each reflecting the diverse cultural tapestry of our country. Our platform will seamlessly integrate with government post office logistics, ensuring reliable and efficient shipping of these unique treasures to destinations worldwide. We empower artisans, promote cultural exchange, and gain access to high-quality, handcrafted products. Join us in fostering economic growth and celebrating craftsmanship.
The private e-Commerce portals charge upto 40% of the sale price of orders, which is prohibitively expensive. ExportEase provides exporters with a cost-effective and accessible solution for their export logisticsÂ requirements.
